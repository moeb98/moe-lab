# Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit
maintained independently of any company. Prometheus collects and stores
its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with
the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs
called labels.
